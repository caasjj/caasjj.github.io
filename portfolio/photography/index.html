    <p>I've never really understood how freezing a live moment on paper or screen can give that moment more life,
      make it appear more vibrant and more meaningful than when you were actually living it. I don't know whether
      it's the experience of reliving a moment from the past through a slightly different version of ourselves,
      the ability to examine some details we may have missed, or something more. I suspect it's something more,
      having to do with secrets buried in the mechanisms of our cognition. What I do know is how images make
      me feel, and I suppose that's my attraction to photography.

      I don't have a dark room any more, and can't justify building one. Still, I sometimes feel that the
      instantaneous gratification afforded by digital photography, and its magnification of my skills, whatever they
      are,
      make the art feel less personal to me. I sense the images are technically more beautiful but with less of my
      own touch in them, for better or worse. I certainly wouldn't intentionally degrade the technical quality of an
      image, but I always try to keep the technology from washing out the human imperfections of my perspective. We're
      imperfect and we perceive imperfectly, and that is important to remember, and more important yet to preserve.
      Photography, for me, represents the balance between the love I have for technology and the struggle to keep it
      from completely scrubbing away our perfect human imperfections.
