This document is a overview of using Docker.


## Docker

Docker is a client-server application.  The server is a daemon that can receive commands from a client.  Under Linux, both of these run under the host Linux OS.

### Docker with Mac OS X

Docker server runs only on Linux and Mac OS X does not have the kernel features it needs. So, you need to run a linux kernel inside Mac OS and run Docker inside of that kernel.  This is accomplished with [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/). Installation instructions are on Docker site at [Install boot2docker](http://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/).

![Alt text](/assets/img/docker-in-mac-osx.png)

* Start boot2docker with `boot2docker start`
* Stop boot2docker with `boot2docker stop`
* Update boot2docker with `boot2docker download`
* Get boot2docker IP address with `boot2docker ip` 
   * `192.168.59.103:2375`, but VirtualBox's DHCP might change it
*  Default username is `docker` and password `tcuser`
* Run boot2docker management tool with `boot2docker`

Docker's client runs directly under the Mac OS X as a regular application.  

{% highlight bash %}
boot2docker
Usage: ./boot2docker [<options>]
{help|init|up|ssh|save|down|poweroff|reset|restart|config|status|info|ip|delete|download|version} [<args>]
{% endhighlight %}

## Running Docker

* Get the version of docker client and server running with `docker version` , notice no `--` before `version`.
* To get a list of all docker *client* commands, just type `docker`.
* To get help on a specific command, type `docker <command> --help`

### Managing Images

* Get list of installed images with `docker images`
* Search for images on [Docker Hub Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/) with `docker search <image>`

#### Creating Images

You can create images by 

  1. Updating and saving an existing image
  2. Creating a `Dockerfile` and building an image

  
#### Updating an Existing Image
  
To update an existing image, first create a container based on the image and start a shell:

  `docker run -i -t <source-image> /bin/bash`

Make note of the returned container id as `container-id`.

Next, make any modifications to the environment inside the container - e.g. install packages, initialize data, etc.

Exist from the shell with `exit`.

Commit the new image with

 `docker commit -m "some commit message" <container-id> <username>/<image-name>:<tag>`, 
 
 where `container-id` is from the above container, `<username>` is whatever name you want to indicate as the owner of this image, and `image-name` and `tag` are whatever you want to name and tag your image.

Now, you can create a container from this new image with, for example,

 `docker run -i -t <username>/<image-name>:<tag> /bin/bash`.

#### Create from a Dockerfile

Here, we first create a `Dockerfile` with for example: 

{% highlight bash %}
# This is a comment
FROM ubuntu:14.04
MAINTAINER Kate Smith <ksmith@example.com>
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ruby ruby-dev
RUN gem install sinatra
{% endhighlight %}

Then, we issue a `build` with 

`docker build -t <username>/<image-name>:<tag> <path-to-dockerfile>` 

in the directory where the `Dockerfile` resides. 

Note that you can always add a tag to an existing image with 

`sudo docker tag <image-id> <username>/<image-name>:<tag>`

For complete details of `Dockerfile` configuration, see [Dockerfile Reference][2] 

#### Pushing an Image to Docker Hub

You can always push an image to Docker Hub with 

`sudo docker push <username>/<image-name>:<tag>`  

You will be asked for your credentials on the command line.

#### Deleting an Image

Delete an image from the host with 

`docker rmi <username>/<image-name>:<tag>` 

- of course, the image may or may not have a `username` and `tag`.

### Managing Containers

Containers can be run interactively in the foreground or as `daemons` in the background, using the `-d` flag.

* You can list all running containers with `docker ps`, and included stopped containers with `docker ps -a`
* To see the `stdout` of a container, use `docker logs`
* Stop a container with `docker stop <container-id>`

`docker run <image> <command>` will create a container from source image `<image>` and run `<command>` in it.  If the `command` exits immediately, then the container will be stopped - but not deleted under `docker run --rm <image> <command>` is issued.

Examples: 

`docker run ununtu:14.04 echo 'Hello World'`
 
`docker run --rm ununtu:14.04 echo 'Hello World'` 

To see what processes are running in a container, you can issue the Linus `top` command:

`docker top <container-id>`


#### Creating Containers

You can create a container either with `docker run` or `docker create`.  The first will create and run the container and the second will create the container and let you run it subsequently with `docker start`.

You can run a container interactively with, for example,

* `docker run -it <image-name> /bin/bash` - create a container, login to bash and leave container stopped after `exit`
* `docker run --rm <image-name> echo 'Hello World'` - create container, echo 'Hello World' and then delete stopped container
* `docker run -it --rm <image-name> /bin/bash` - create a container, login to bash and delete container stopped after `exit`

To run a container in the background as a `daemon`, use the `-d` flag.  You can then stop the container with `docker stop <container-id>`.

* `docker run -d -P <image-name> <command>` - run application in `<command>` inside a container based on `<image-name>` and map ports (`-P`)

You can replace any of the above `run` commands with `create` and then subsequently start the container with `docker start <container-id>`.


#### Container Port Mapping

You can run an application inside a container based on `image-name` with

 `docker run -d -P <image-name> <run app>`
 
This will map any ports used by the `app` to random ports on the host.  To explicitly map a port from the container to a port on the host, use the `-p` option, as opposed to `-P`:

`docker run -d -p host-port:container-port <image-name> <run app>`

To see the port mapping between the host (i.e. boot2docker in Mac OS X, but the actual host in Linux), use the command:

`docker port <container-id>`

For example: 

{% highlight bash %}
docker port b2653c7abd1e
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:49160
{% endhighlight %}

The above indicates that `TCP` port `8080` on the container is mapped to port `49160` on the `localhost`. HOWEVER, on Mac OS X, `localhost` is not the Mac OS itself, but the linux kernel running inside `boot2docker`.  To get that IP address, issue the command:

`boot2docker ip`

As indicated above, this is typiecally `193.168.59.103` so the above service would be at `localhost:49160` on Linux and `193.168.59.103:491601` on Mac.

You can add a line in `/etc/hosts` to give this a hostname of `dockerhost` with :

`echo $(docker-ip) dockerhost | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

Or of course, you could edit the file by hand and add the following line:

{% highlight bash %}
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost 
fe80::1%lo0     localhost
192.168.59.103 dockerhost
{% endhighlight %}


#### Connecting to a Running Container

To open a shell in an existing, running container, use the `exec` command. 

`docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash`

#### Using Data Volumes

You can create additional volumes, either standalone or by connecting to a host volume, in a container by using the `-v` flag:

* `docker run -i -t --rm -v /somedata ubuntu /bin/bash` will create a container with a `/somedata` directory mounted
* `docker run -i -t --rm -v /Users/<user>/directory:/somedata ubuntu /bin/bash` will mount the `~/directory` directory into `/somedata` in the container

> A limitation on Mac OS X is that the mounted local directory has to be in `/Users`!

You can also create a named *Data Volume Container* to store data you want to persist, or share among multiple containers.  You do this with :

`docker create -v <container-path> --name <container-name> <image-name>`

This will *not* run the image, but use it as a common layer for all containers sharing this container.

Now, you can mount this volume to any other container with the `--volumes-from` flag in multiple containers:

`docker run -d --volumes-from <container-name> --name db1 <image-name>`

`docker run -d --volumes-from <container-name> --name db2 <image-name>`

Both of these containers now share the volume previously created.

Stopping and deleting these containers will *not* remove the volume container.  To delete that, you have to use the `-v` flag with `rm`

`docker rm -v <container-id>`

where `container-id` is the last container with a reference to the volume container.
