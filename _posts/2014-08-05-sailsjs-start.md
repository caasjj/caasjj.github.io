Did not sleep well - in bed around 10:45, woke at 3:30.

* 03:45 - got to my desk
* 04:42 - finished setting up journal, after struggling with some basic settings.
* 05:30 - updated sails to latest (v0.10.1)
* 05:51 - tracked down sails executable, module loading, etc.
    * Still not clear on how exactly sails module gets loaded and instantiates app.
    * `sails` executable is a symlink in `/usr/local/bin` to `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/sails/bin/sails.js` - a node.js command line script.
    * `sails` commands are `lift`, `configure`, `console`, `debug`, `generate`, `new` and `www`.
* 06:09 break
* 07:09 back at desk
* 07:45 joined sails google group and irc channel
