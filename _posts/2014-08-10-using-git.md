This document is a cheatsheet for installing, configuring and using the most common features of <code>git</code>. The most common use cases are covered, but be warned that there is an enormous amount of more advanced material that is not covered. Check out some of the references if you want or need more.
<blockquote>In the code below, the text inside square brackets, e.g. <code>[gadd]</code> is a shortcut alias if you choose to follow my optional set up. Otherwise, feel free to type in the full command or devise your own shortcuts.</blockquote>


<h1>Get Git</h1>
Get the <a title="Git download" href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">latest version</a> and install according to provided instructions.
<h1>Use Git</h1>
<h3>Configure Git</h3>
Username, email and CR/LF handling

{% highlight bash %}

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"

{% endhighlight %}

<sub>PC: Use <code>true</code> instead of <code>input</code> in the first command</sub>

{% highlight bash %}
    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    git config --global core.safecrlf true
{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote>Optional: Set up your aliases, as shown in <a href="#aliases">Aliases</a> below.</blockquote>

<h3>Create Project</h3>
Go to your project's root working directory, and create a <code>.gitignore</code> file tere, with a list of all files (e.g. .DS_Store, if it's not already in your <code>~/.gitignore_global</code> global file) and directories (e.g. <code>.idea/</code> of Webstorm) you do NOT want to go in your repository. Ideally, you should have the common files included in your global ignore file.

{% highlight bash %}
    echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>init</h3>
Initialize a repository

{% highlight bash %}
    init git
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>add</h3>
Use this command to load a file to the staging area of your repository

{% highlight bash %}
    git add [gadd]
{% endhighlight %}


You can add a single file with <code>&lt;fname&gt;</code>, a whole directory with <code>&lt;dir/&gt;</code> or the current directory with<code>.</code>, possibly the most frequent use case. Note that this last option will also add all sub-directories of the current directory.

<h3>commit</h3>
The above only places the files into the staging area, a kind of temporary snapshot you can use to group related changes together to be saved all together at some later point. It is very easy to remove files from the staging area. To get these files saved permanently in the repository, you need to commit your changes
 
 {% highlight bash %}
    git commit -m [gcomm] "..a commit message"
 {% endhighlight %}

Suppose you make a commit, and then realize there were a few other changes you should have included.  You can just amend the existing commit with the command:

 {% highlight bash %}
    git commit --amend -m [gcamm] "..a commit message"
 {% endhighlight %}


This will completely replace the previous commit.  Alternatively, you can <a href="#reset">reset</a> the branch by one commit (see reset, below) and re-submit all your changes.
<h3>status</h3>
To see if files have been changed, staged, etc. type:

{% highlight bash %}
    git status [gstat]
{% endhighlight %}

If you've modified a file, but not yet staged it, you'll see something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
    # On branch master
    # Changes not staged for commit:
    # (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)
    # (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in     working directory)
    #
    # modified: hello.rb
    #
    # Untracked files:
    # (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    # .gitignore
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
{% endhighlight %}
 
To undo changes you've made to a file not yet staged, you can just check it back out of the repo:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] hello.rb
{% endhighlight %}

Once you stage the file using <code>git add [gadd]</code>, you'll see something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    # (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage)
    #
    # modified: hello.rb
    #
    # Untracked files:
    # (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    # .gitignore
 {% endhighlight %}

You can remove the file back out of the staging area, as indicated in the comment, by typing:
 
 {% highlight bash %}
    git reset HEAD [grsh] hello.rb
 {% endhighlight %}

<blockquote>Note that this will ONLY remove the file from the staging area, but will NOT undo the changes made to the local file. To do this, you still have to checkout the file from the repo, as shown above, AFTER unstaging it.</blockquote>
If all your changes were good and have been committed, you should see something more like this:

{% highlight bash %}
    # On branch master
    # Untracked files:
    # (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    # .gitignore
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
{% endhighlight %}

Undoing a commit is a bit more involved than unstaging, and is covered below.
<h3>log</h3>
Use this command to review all the history of your repository. The presentation, as well as the content, of this log is extremely flexible. Refer to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-log.html" target="_blank">git-log man pages</a> for details. A short version, common use set up of the log has been configured in the <code>hist git</code> alias and can be used as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
    git hist [gist]
{% endhighlight %}

The output of this command will look something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
    * a9e5d2f 2013-09-19 | Added a comment (HEAD, v1, master) [caasjj]
    * ed080b3 2013-09-19 | Added a default value (v1-beta) [caasjj]
    * 863f433 2013-09-19 | Using ARGV [caasjj]
    * 1961c03 2013-09-19 | First Commit [caasjj]
{% endhighlight %}

The above hashtags (e.g. <code>a9e5d2f</code>) are abbreviated and can be used to refer to the given commit - e.g. to check out that commit. Full version of the log can be seen with the full <code>git log</code> command.
In order to get a listing of all the branches (see below), issue the command with the <code>--all</code> option.

{% highlight bash %}
    git hist [gist] --all
{% endhighlight %}

Below, you can see both the master branch and a new greet branch. 

{% highlight bash %}
    * 67242f8 2013-09-19 | Added README (HEAD, master)[caasjj]
    | * 1151e95 2013-09-19 | Fixed Rakefile (greet)[caasjj]
    | * bc17330 2013-09-19 | Hello uses Greeter [caasjj]
    | * f98947e 2013-09-19 | Added greeter class [caasjj]
    |/  
    * d11ccf9 2013-09-19 | Added a Rakefile [caasjj]
    * a9e5d2f 2013-09-19 | Added a comment (v1) [caasjj]
    * ed080b3 2013-09-19 | Added a default value (v1-beta) [caasjj]
    * 863f433 2013-09-19 | Using ARGV [caasjj]
    * 1961c03 2013-09-19 | First Commit [caasjj]
{% endhighlight %}
 
<h3>checkout</h3>
Use this command to switch to a different version of your source. Use it with a hashtag from the <cpde>log</code> command to switch to a previous commit. Use it with a branch name to switch to a different branch, or with a <code>-b flag</code> to create a branch.  Or, use it with a tag name to switch to a different tag. These will be explained below. For now, to switch back e.g. to the 2nd commit of our repository, with hashtag <code>863f433</code>, we would type:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] 863f433
{% endhighlight %}

This will set all your files back to what they were in that commit, but since that commit is not itself a branch, you get the following warning:

{% highlight bash %}
    Note: checking out '863f433'.
    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout. If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:git checkout -b new_branch_name

    HEAD is now at 863f433... Using ARGV
{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote>This simply means that if you make changes to any files and then switch back to a branch or different commit, then all your changes will be lost UNLESS you create another branch with your changes.</blockquote>
You can go back to the <code>master</code> branch by typing:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] master
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>tag</h3>
Use this command to give a commit a name, and then refer to that commit with that name rather than its hash. To tag the current commit with the tag <code>v1</code>, use the command:

{% highlight bash %}
    git tag [gtag] v1
{% endhighlight %}

To delete the <code>v1</code> tag, just type:

{% highlight bash %}
    git tag [gtag] -d v1
{% endhighlight %}

To tag a different version from the commit you're working on, simply check it out first, and then tag it:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] 863f433
    git tag [gtag] v1-beta
{% endhighlight %}

You can of course checkout commits by their tags:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] v1
{% endhighlight %}

And you can also look for tags in the logs:

{% highlight bash %}
    git hist [gist] master --all
{% endhighlight %}

Here, you need the <code>master --all</code> in case you are on a commit that is older than the latest and still want to see any tags after the commit you're on.

<h3>revert</h3>
This command can be used to undo changes done by a <strong>commit</strong>. To reverse the changes made by the last commit, type:

{% highlight bash %}
    git revert HEAD [grev]
{% endhighlight %}

After the above revert, the history log looks as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
    * 86d2e1a 2013-09-19 | Revert "Added a comment" (HEAD, master) [caasjj]
    * a9e5d2f 2013-09-19 | Added a comment (v1) [caasjj]
    * ed080b3 2013-09-19 | Added a default value (v1- beta) [caasjj]
    * 863f433 2013-09-19 | Using ARGV [caasjj]
    * 1961c03 2013-09-19 | First Commit [caasjj]
{% endhighlight %}


Note that all the command did was to generate a new commit counteracting the effects of the previous one.  No information has been lost, so this command is safe to use on branches that have been shared and potentially cloned by other users.  Note however, that all changes (both the original commit, and the take-back revert commit) are visible to all in the log.
<h3><a name="reset"></a>reset</h3>
Reset completely removes the changes back to the point indicated from the branch - but not from the repository.  This is as close to an 'undo' command as git has!
In order to have access to the deleted changes, first tag the soon to be deleted commit.  Then, issue a reset command back in time to a desired commit.

{% highlight bash %}
git tag [gtag] undone_changes
git reset [grst] --hard v1
{% endhighlight %}

The above will remove all changes after <code>v1</code> from the <code>master</code> branch, but the changes between <code>v1</code> and the current point are still available with the <code>undone_changes</code> tag.  The state will be <code>v1</code>.

<blockquote>Because <code>reset</code> erases history, as far as the branch is concerned, do NOT issue a <code>reset</code> on changes that have been publicly shared.  That is if a branch at time <code>t1</code> was shared publicly, do not reset back to a commit before time <code>t1</code>.</blockquote>

<h3>mv</h3>
To move a file, e.g. to a different sub-directory, use the command:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir lib
git mv [gmv] hello.rb lib
{% endhighlight %}

This will result in the following output:

{% highlight bash %}
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #	renamed:    hello.rb -> lib/hello.rb
    #
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #	.gitignore
{% endhighlight %}

The above operation is essentially the same as:

{% highlight bash %}
    mkdir lib
    mv hello.rb lib
    git add lib/hello.rb
    git rm hello.rb
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>rm</h3>
As the unix pedigree of the name implies, this command is used to delete a file from the repository.  That is, this command does the opposite of <code>add</code>. It removes the local file and stages the file as deleted.  A subsequent commit removes it from the branch.  Assuming that a file named <code>junk</code> has been committed, then the following command will delete it from the workspace and issue the subsequent output:

{% highlight bash %}
    git rm junk
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage) 
    #
    #	deleted:    junk
    #
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #	.gitignore
{% endhighlight %}

The next commit will remove it from the branch.
<h3>cat-file</h3>
Used to dump contents of files, commit objects, directories, etc.
<h3><a name="branch"></a>branch</h3>
Use the <code>branch</code> command to list all the branches, or to create a new branch. To switch branches, as shown above, you can just <code>git checkout [gck] &lt;branch&gt;</code>. To create a branch named <code>refactor</code> and switch to that branch:

{% highlight bash %}
    git branch [gbr] greet
{% endhighlight %}

We can list both branches now as using the log (hist) command:

{% highlight bash %}
    git hist [gist] --all
    * 67242f8 2013-09-19 | Added README (HEAD, master) [caasjj]
    | * 1151e95 2013-09-19 | Fixed Rakefile (greet) [caasjj]
    | * bc17330 2013-09-19 | Hello uses Greeter [caasjj]
    | * f98947e 2013-09-19 | Added greeter class [caasjj]
    |/  
    * d11ccf9 2013-09-19 | Added a Rakefile [caasjj]
    * a9e5d2f 2013-09-19 | Added a comment (v1) [caasjj]
    * ed080b3 2013-09-19 | Added a default value (v1-beta) [caasjj]
    * 863f433 2013-09-19 | Using ARGV [caasjj]
    * 1961c03 2013-09-19 | First Commit [caasjj]
 {% endhighlight %}

To switch to the greet branch:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] greet
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, you can perform both of these in shorthand form as:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout -b [gckb] greet
{% endhighlight %}

To list all the existing branches:

{% highlight bash %}
    git branch [gbr]
{% endhighlight %}


<h3><a name="merge"></a>merge</h3>
Starting with the branches shown above, suppose we want to merge the master branch onto the greet branch.  We do this with:

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] master
    git merge [gmrg] master
{% endhighlight %}

And we end up with the following history:
 
 {% highlight bash %}
    git hist [gist] --all
    *   a0cbaae 2013-09-19 | Merge branch 'master' into greet (HEAD, greet) [caasjj]
    |\  
    | * 67242f8 2013-09-19 | Added README (master) [caasjj]
    * | 1151e95 2013-09-19 | Fixed Rakefile [caasjj]
    * | bc17330 2013-09-19 | Hello uses Greeter [caasjj]
    * | f98947e 2013-09-19 | Added greeter class [caasjj]
    |/  
    * d11ccf9 2013-09-19 | Added a Rakefile [caasjj]
    * a9e5d2f 2013-09-19 | Added a comment (v1) [caasjj]
    * ed080b3 2013-09-19 | Added a default value (v1-beta) [caasjj]
    * 863f433 2013-09-19 | Using ARGV [caasjj]
    * 1961c03 2013-09-19 | First Commit [caasjj]
 {% endhighlight %}

Here, all the changes from the <code>master</code> branch were applied to the <code>merge</code> branch and the final branch selected is the <code>greet</code> branch.  The <code>master</code> branch is left unchanged, as can be seen below.

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] master
    git hist [gist]
    * 67242f8 2013-09-19 | Added README (HEAD, master) [caasjj]
    * d11ccf9 2013-09-19 | Added a Rakefile [caasjj]
    * a9e5d2f 2013-09-19 | Added a comment (v1) [caasjj]
    * ed080b3 2013-09-19 | Added a default value (v1-beta) [caasjj]
    * 863f433 2013-09-19 | Using ARGV [caasjj]
    * 1961c03 2013-09-19 | First Commit [caasjj]
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, we did not modify the same section of any given file in both branches.  If this happens, we have a <strong>merge conflict</strong>, and that needs to be resolved by hand.  In this case, attempting to merge will yield this:

{% highlight bash %}
    git merge master
    Auto-merging lib/hello.rb
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in lib/hello.rb
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
 {% endhighlight %}
   
Opening the <code>hello.rb</code> file will show the problem:

{% highlight bash %}
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    require 'greeter'

    # Default is World
    name = ARGV.first || "World"

    greeter = Greeter.new(name)
    puts greeter.greet
    =======
    # Default is World

    puts "What's your name"
    my_name = gets.strip

    puts "Hello, #{my_name}!"
    >>>>>>> master
{% endhighlight %}

Git has no way of knowing what the intended and final changes should be.  You need to manually fix the file and then add and commit the file:

{% highlight bash %}
    git add lib/hello.rb
    git commit -m "Merged master fixed conflict."
    Recorded resolution for 'lib/hello.rb'.
    [greet 25f0e8c] Merged master fixed conflict.
{% endhighlight %}


<h3>clone</h3>
More frequently, you will want to copy an external project to work on, rather than create a project completely from scratch.  This is where the concept of remote repositories come in.  The following will create an exact replica of a remote <code>clone</code> repository into a local <code>repo_clone</code> repository.

{% highlight bash %}
    git clone repo repo_clone
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to clone a specific branch of a remote repository, first, get a listing of all the remote branches

{% highlight bash %}
    git branch [gbr] -a
{% endhighlight %}

Then, checkout with the -b flag

{% highlight bash %}
    git checkout [gck] -b <branchname> <origin/branchname>
{% endhighlight %}

Refer to this great <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-do-i-clone-all-remote-branches-with-git" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> question for more details.

<h3>remote</h3>
Cloned repositories are aware of where they were cloned from.  You can get this via

{% highlight bash %}
    git remote [grmt]
{% endhighlight %}

and get the response 

{% highlight bash %}
    origin
{% endhighlight %}

If you type 

{% highlight bash %}
    git remote show [grmts] origin
{% endhighlight %}

you see that <code>origin</code> is just the repo from which repo_clone was copied.
 
 {% highlight bash %}
    * remote origin
    Fetch URL:  /Users/jim/working/git/git_immersion/auto/hello
    Push  URL: /Users/jim/working/git/git_immersion/auto/hello
    HEAD branch (remote HEAD is ambiguous, may be one of the following):
    greet
    master
    Remote branches:
    greet  tracked
    master tracked
    Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
    Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use the remote command to add a remote repository, from which you can clone repository and to which you can push repositories.  You can add a remote repository with:

{% highlight bash %}
    git remote add [grmta] origin remote_repo     (https://github.com/.../xxx.git)
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>fetch</h3>

The rest of the world doesn't sit idle while you're working on your cloned repo.  To grab these changes, and then merge them into your local repo, you use the <code>fetch</code> command followed by <code>merge origin/master</code> - while in your cloned repo of course, and assuming you're working on your
<code>master</code> branch.

{% highlight bash %}
    git fetch
    git merge [gmrg] origin/master
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>pull</h3>
If you know you want to <code>fetch</code> and <code>merge origin/master</code>, you can do both with a single command:

{% highlight bash %}
    git pull
{% endhighlight %}
  
This is identical to the two statements above.

<h3>push</h3>
Once you've made changes to your local repo and want to update the remote (after you've pulled and merged their latest), you use the command:

{% highlight bash %}
    git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

where <code>origin</code> is the name you gave to the remote repo when you added it using <code>git remote add [grmta]</code>, and master is the branch you are working on.
## 

<h1><a name="aliases"></a>Alias Git</h1>
It gets tedious real quick to constantly type <code>checkout</code> or <code>commit</code>, etc. over and over again. The following aliases provide shortcuts for most common tasks. The first set of aliases in the <code>~/.gitconfig</code> can be used directly with git, e.g. <code>git br</code> for <code>git branch</code>. The second set are bash aliases and can be used on their own, e.g. <code>gadd &lt;file&gt;</code> for <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>

Add the following to your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:

{% highlight bash %}
    [alias]
    co = checkout
    ci = commit
    st = status
    br = branch
    hist = log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
    type = cat-file -t
    dump = cat-file -p
{% endhighlight %}

Then, in your <code>~/.profile</code> file, include the following:

{% highlight bash %}
    alias gs='git status '
    alias ga='git add '
    alias gb='git branch '
    alias gc='git commit'
    alias gd='git diff'
    alias go='git checkout '

    alias gck='git checkout '
    alias gbr='git branch '
    alias gmv='git mv '
    alias grm='git rm '

    alias gist='git hist '
    alias gadd='git add '
    alias gbra='git branch -a '
    alias gcom='git commit '
    alias gckb='git checkout -b '
    alias gcam='git commit --amend '
    alias gmrg='git merge '
    alias gdif='git diff '
    alias gtag='git tag '
    alias grmt='git remote '
    alias grsh='git reset HEAD '
    alias grst='git reset --hard '         
    alias grev='git revert HEAD '
    
    alias grmts='git remote show'
    alias grmta='git remote add'
    alias gcatt='git cat-file -t ' 
    alias gcatp='git cat-file -p ' 
    alias gstat='git status ' 
    alias gcomm='git commit -m '
    alias gcamm='git commit --amend -m '  
{% endhighlight %}
